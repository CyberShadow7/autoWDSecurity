## Reporting a Vulnerability
<!--
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

In case there are any vulnerabilities found, please include the following information :<br />
-	Steps to reproduce said vulnerability / bug (including tools used, method(s), etc.)<br />
-	Access the attacker gets<br />
-	Estimated threat level (0..10, decimals accepted. This has to comply with the CVE Vulnerability Rating System so read about it first)<br />
-	Suggestions<br />

Out of scope topics include Linux kernel or distribution-specific vulnerabilities. Those should be addressed to the Linux kernel/specific distro team and not to me.
